# Backend Structure Document

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the backend setup for our project. The main goal of the project is to allow users to share URLs from their iPhone seamlessly, have these URLs processed using AI summarization, and store all the relevant information in an organized way. The backend is the engine that receives each URL from an iOS Shortcut, processes it using the Grok AI summarization service, and stores the results in a database. Its design aims to be simple yet powerful, ensuring that the overall experience remains smooth and efficient for everyone.

## Backend Architecture

The backend is designed using a modern architecture that is both scalable and easy to maintain. It is built with Node.js, which runs our server-side logic to accept incoming requests from our iOS Shortcut and other parts of the application. This server interacts with external services, such as the Grok AI summarization service used to process webpage content. The system is organized around a clear API structure that communicates with the frontend, ensuring that data flows seamlessly between your iPhone, our database, and the website. The design choices made here help the backend handle increasing traffic and new features without impacting performance.

## Database Management

Our system uses PostgreSQL for storing all the collected data, including the URLs, summaries, page titles, date accessed, and associated tags. The connection to the database is managed through Supabase, which not only simplifies our database interactions but also handles user authentication. Data is structured in a way that allows entries to be easily queried, filtered, and organized. Every URL entry has its own record with all relevant metadata, ensuring that information is both secure and readily accessible for display on the web dashboard.

## API Design and Endpoints

The backend provides a set of well-designed API endpoints to facilitate communication between the frontend and the backend services. The APIs follow standard RESTful design principles, ensuring clarity and simplicity. For instance, one key endpoint receives the URL data sent by the iOS Shortcut along with additional metadata such as the page title and date. After receiving this data, the API triggers the request to the Grok summarization service and then stores the resulting summary along with tags in the database. In cases where the summarization process fails, the URL is still stored with an appropriate status. This clear separation of duties makes it straightforward for each part of the system to interact effectively.

## Hosting Solutions

The backend is hosted on firebase, a cloud platform known for its excellent integration and ease of use. firebase was chosen because it offers highly reliable deployment options that are both scalable and cost-effective. The platform simplifies the process of going live with the backend by handling infrastructure concerns like load balancing and automatic scaling. This ensures that as more users share URLs and access the web dashboard, the system remains responsive and stable.

## Infrastructure Components

The overall infrastructure of the backend includes several important components that work together seamlessly. A load balancer helps manage incoming traffic, ensuring that no single server becomes overwhelmed. Caching mechanisms may be in place to optimize performance and reduce the response time when fetching frequently requested data. Additionally, a Content Delivery Network (CDN) is used to quickly deliver static content of the web app to end users. Together, these components ensure that both the processing of data and the delivery of content happen swiftly and reliably, improving the overall user experience.

## Security Measures

Security is a top priority in our backend design. We use secure communication channels (HTTPS) to protect data traveling between the userâ€™s iPhone, the backend server, and the database. User authentication is handled by Supabase using Google sign-in, which employs OAuth protocols for a secure login process. This ensures that only authorized users can access or alter their data. Data encryption is applied where necessary, and robust error handling is in place to prevent unauthorized data access. With these measures, user data such as links, summaries, and metadata is kept safe and compliant with modern security standards.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To ensure that the backend remains healthy and performs at its best, we use a combination of monitoring tools and regular maintenance practices. Various logging services track system performance and errors, alerting the team if any issues arise. Performance metrics are continuously monitored to catch any slowdowns or spikes in resource usage. Routine maintenance tasks, such as database optimization and server updates, are planned to keep everything running smoothly. This proactive approach ensures that the backend remains robust and reliable over time.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

In summary, the backend for this project is built to handle the seamless sharing and processing of URLs from an iPhone while maintaining high performance and security. It uses a Node.js server that interacts with a PostgreSQL database managed via Supabase, and it integrates with the Grok AI summarization service for processing webpage content. Deployed on firebase and supported by essential infrastructure components like load balancers and CDNs, the backend offers a scalable and secure solution that fits perfectly with the project's goals. Overall, this setup not only meets the immediate needs of URL sharing and summarization but also lays the foundation for future enhancements and a smooth user experience.
